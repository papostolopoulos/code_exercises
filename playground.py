# LONG REPEAT https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/long-repeat/
# There are four substring missions that were born all in one day and
# you shouldnâ€™t be needed more than one day to solve them.
# All of those mission can be simply solved by brute force, but is it always
# the best way to go? (you might not have access to all of those missions yet,
# but they are going to be available with more opened islands on the map).
#
# This mission is the first one of the series. Here you should find the length
# of the longest substring that consists of the same letter.
# For example, line "aaabbcaaaa" contains four substrings with the same letters
# "aaa", "bb","c" and "aaaa".
# The last substring is the longest one which makes it an answer.
#
# Input: String.
#
# Output: Int.
#
# Example:
#
# long_repeat('sdsffffse') == 4
# long_repeat('ddvvrwwwrggg') == 3
