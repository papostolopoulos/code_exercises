PEARLS IN THE BOX https://js.checkio.org/en/mission/box-probability/

To start the game, they put several black and white pearls in one of the boxes.
Each robots have Nth moves, then initial set are restored for a next player.
For each move, the robot take a pearl out of the box and put one of the
opposite color back. The winner is the one who pulls the white pearl on the
Nth step (or +1 point if they play many parties).

Our robots don't like indeterminacy and want to know the probability
of a white pearl on the Nth step. The probability is a value between 0
(0% chance or will not happen) and 1 (100% chance or will happen).
The result is a float from 0 to 1 with two digits precision (Â±0.01).

You are given a start set of pearls as a string that contains "b"
(black) and "w" (white) and the number of the step (N).
The order of the pearls does not matter.

probability
Input: The start sequence of the pearls as a string and the step number as an integer.
Output: The probability for a white pearl as a float.

Example:
boxProbability('bbw', 3) == 0.48
boxProbability('wwb', 3) == 0.52
boxProbability('www', 3) == 0.56
boxProbability('bbbb', 1) == 0
boxProbability('wwbb', 4) == 0.5
boxProbability('bwbwbwb', 5) == 0.48
